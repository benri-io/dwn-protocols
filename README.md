---

This repository contains a collection of compatible decentralized web node
protocols that can be used to build and operate decentralized web applications.
The specification for protocols can be found
[here](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/#protocols). With
the DWeb Node Protocols mechanism, one can model the underpinning protocols for
a vast array of use cases in a way that enables interop-by-default between app
implementations that ride on top of them.

As time moves on, this repository will have multiple channels: `stable`,
`nightly`, and `beta` for example for experimental channels up to the tried and
true.
