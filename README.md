# DWN Protocol Collection

[![Protocol Pull Request](https://github.com/benri-io/dwn-protocols/actions/workflows/test-pr.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/benri-io/dwn-protocols/actions/workflows/test-pr.yaml)

**STATUS:** DRAFT: Nothing is set in stone yet. Feedback/suggestions, even breaking large ones, are welcome.

---
This repository contains a collection of compatible decentralized web node
protocols that can be used to build and operate decentralized web applications.
The specification for protocols can be found
[here](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/#protocols). With
the DWeb Node Protocols mechanism, one can model the underpinning protocols for
a vast array of use cases in a way that enables interop-by-default between app
implementations that ride on top of them.

As time moves on, this repository will have multiple channels: `stable`,
`nightly`, and `beta` for example for experimental channels up to the tried and
true.
